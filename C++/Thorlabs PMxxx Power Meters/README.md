### Thorlabs PMxxx Power Meters
In this folder you can find sample codes show how you can control a Thorlabs PMxxx Power Meter in C++. 
You can control the unit with the Thorlabs Powermeter driver or directly with SCPI commands. 

There are two sub folders:

 - **TLPMx:** Code samples using the Thorlabs Power Meter driver dll named TLPMx. This is the more convenient method. For closer info read [Readme](TLPMX_dll).
 - **scpi:** Code examples using directly text based [SCPI](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Commands_for_Programmable_Instruments) commands. This low level access allows direct access to the device functionality. For closer info read [Readme](scpi).
