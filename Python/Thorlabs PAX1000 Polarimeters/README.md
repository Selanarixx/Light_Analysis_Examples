# Thorlabs PAX Polarimeter communication using Python
In this folder you can find sample codes show how you can control a Thorlabs PAX Polarimeter in Python. You can control the PAX with the
Thorlabs PAX driver or directly with SCPI commands.

There are three sub folders:

 - **TLPAX dll:** Code samples using the Thorlabs PAX Polarimeter driver dll named TLPAX. This is the more convenient method. For closer info read [Readme](TLPAX_dll).
 - **scpi:** Code examples using directly text based [SCPI](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Commands_for_Programmable_Instruments) commands. This low level method allows direct access to the device functionality. For closer info read [Readme](scpi).
