## Included Example

### Thorlabs PMxxx Power Meters
In this folder you can find sample codes show how you can control a Thorlabs PMxxx Power Meter in Python. You can control the PM with the
Thorlabs Powermeter driver or directly with SCPI commands. 

There are three sub folders:

 - **TLPMX dll:** Code samples using the Thorlabs Power Meter driver dll. This is the more convenient method. For closer info read [Readme](TLPMX_dll).
 - **scpi:** Code examples using directly SCPI commands. This low level access allows direct access to the device functionality. For closer info read [Readme](scpi).
 - **Obsolete:** This folder contains the sample codes for the obsoleted TLPM drivers.
